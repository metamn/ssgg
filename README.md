## SSGG &mdash; Static Site and Styleguide Generator with Gulp

Remember [Jekyll?](http://jekyllrb.com/).
This is very similar with the following differences:

* Less opinionated
* Fully extendable
* Generates a styleguide in sync with the site

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/metamn/ssgg
cd ssgg
npm install
```
